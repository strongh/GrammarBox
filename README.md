GrammarBox
=

GrammarBox is a very simple webapp built using NLTK, web.py, jQuery, and RaphaÃ«l. The user types a sentence into a text box, and GrammarBox tags the tokens in the sentence and draws the appropriate Montessori part-of-speech shape above each token. 


GrammarBox is inspired by language activities in a primary Montessori classroom environment.


It is bare bones, pre-alpha-quality, and is not recommended for any practical use. Enjoy!
